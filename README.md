# Optimization of PID Controller for Cruise Control System using Genetic Algorithm

Modern automobiles are equipped with various driver assistance functions which enhance safety and relieve driver fatigue. With the development of sensor technology, the Cruise Control system has been put into practice. 

This case study discusses the modelling and design of a cruise control system. The system model, which is highly nonlinear, has been linearized around the equilibrium point. The controller has been designed for the linearized model, by taking the dominant pole concept in the closed loop characteristic equation.  
The open loop performance is analysed and according to the design requirements a  Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is designed and implemented. The PID controller is then tuned using different methods, first by optimising it using the Ziegler-Nichols method. Later, The PID controller parameters, i.e. proportional,integral and derivative parameters have been tuned using Genetic Algorithm (GA). 

The performance characteristics are then compared and evaluated. The transient and frequency response analysis of the final system is then discussed using Bode plot, and Step response diagrams.
